# mental-health-treatment-analysis
This project addresses the growing challenge of mental health treatment accessibility by developing a machine learning framework that both predicts treatment-seeking behavior and recommends personalized interventions.

Objectives
-Predict whether an individual will seek mental health treatment.
-Identify meaningful behavioral clusters using unsupervised learning.
-Generate tailored treatment recommendations based on clustering insights.

Methods
Supervised Learning Models:
-Logistic Regression
-Random Forest
-LightGBM (best performance)

Unsupervised Learning:
K-Means clustering (k=4)

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Recall, F1-score

Best Model:
LightGBM with Accuracy=0.74, Recall=0.86, F1=0.78
